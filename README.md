# UMLSPNP
GUI application capable of transforming certain UML diagrams into Stochastic Reward Net and generating CSPL code which represents it. The generated code can be directly executed by the SPNP tool to solve the model (numerical analysis or simulation). SPNP Tool: https://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/TGI/PetriNets/tools/db/spnp.html

This application is the output of Ondrej Marek's Master's thesis: https://is.muni.cz/auth/th/lk9bb/
